# üéÆ GameVault - Consolidated Game Library

**GameVault** is a personal game library manager and price tracker that brings your entire game collection together in one place. No more switching between Steam, Epic Games, Xbox, PlayStation, and other launchers just to see what you own. GameVault helps you browse and organize games from multiple platforms with minimal effort, features automatic syncing (where possible), a FastAPI-powered web interface, and a planned store section to help you find the best deals on new titles.

## ‚ú® Why GameVault?

Launching multiple game clients just to check your library is tedious. GameVault solves this by:
- Syncing your owned games from various platforms
- Displaying your entire collection on a single, clean web interface
- Helping you track, browse, and manage your games in one place
- Planning a Store & Buy feature to show the cheapest platforms to purchase new games

## üì¶ Features

‚úÖ **Game Library Consolidation**  
- Displays your complete game library in one place  
- Clear separation for unmatched items and non-game media  

‚úÖ **Epic Games Sync (Browser Extension Assisted)**  
- Due to the lack of an official API or proper library tab on the Epic Games website, GameVault uses a **custom browser extension**  
- After logging in to Epic Games, users click the extension button to fetch their transaction history  
- Purchased games are then synced to the GameVault database  

‚úÖ **Frontend & Backend with FastAPI**  
- Clean web interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**  
- Served via a **FastAPI** backend  
- Game icons retrieved from **IGDB**  

‚úÖ **Planned Features**  
- Support for syncing:  
  - Steam  
  - Xbox  
  - PlayStation  
- **Store & Buy section**  
  - Browse games available for purchase  
  - Automatically find the **cheapest platform** to buy a game  
- Advanced search and filtering
